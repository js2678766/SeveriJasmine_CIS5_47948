    1. Miles per Gallon
    Write a program that calculates a carâ€™s gas mileage. The program should ask the user
    to enter the number of gallons of gas the car can hold and the number of miles it can
    be driven on a full tank. It should then display the number of miles that may be driven
    per gallon of gas.
