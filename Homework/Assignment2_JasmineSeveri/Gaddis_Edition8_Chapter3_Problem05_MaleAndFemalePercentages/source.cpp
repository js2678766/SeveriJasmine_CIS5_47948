    5. Male and Female Percentages
    Write a program that asks the user for the number of males and the number of females
    registered in a class. The program should display the percentage of males and females
    in the class.
    Hint: Suppose there are 8 males and 12 females in a class. There are 20 students in the
    class. The percentage of males can be calculated as 8 รท 20 = 0.4, or 40%. The percentage
    of females can be calculated as 12 รท 20 = 0.6, or 60%.
