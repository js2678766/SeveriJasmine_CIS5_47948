 * Purpose: 1. Sum of Numbers
 * Write a program that asks the user for a positive integer value. The program should use
 * a loop to get the sum of all the integers from 1 up to the number entered. For example,
 * if the user enters 50, the loop will find the sum of 1, 2, 3, 4, â€¦ 50.
 * Input Validation: Do not accept a negative starting number.
