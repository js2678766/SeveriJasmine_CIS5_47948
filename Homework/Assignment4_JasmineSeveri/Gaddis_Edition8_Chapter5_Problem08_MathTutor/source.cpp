 * Purpose: 8. Math Tutor
 * This program started in Programming Challenge 15 of Chapter 3 , and was modified
 * in Programming Challenge 9 of Chapter 4 . Modify the program again so it displays a
 * menu allowing the user to select an addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division
 * problem. The final selection on the menu should let the user quit the program. After
 * the user has finished the math problem, the program should display the menu again.
 * This process is repeated until the user chooses to quit the program.
 * Input Validation: If the user selects an item not on the menu, display an error message
 * and display the menu again.
