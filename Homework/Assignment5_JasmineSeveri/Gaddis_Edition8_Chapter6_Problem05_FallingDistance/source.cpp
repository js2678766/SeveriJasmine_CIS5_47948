 * Purpose: Falling Distance
 * When an object is falling because of gravity, the following formula can be used to
 * determine the distance the object falls in a specific time period:
 * d = 1/2gt2
 * The variables in the formula are as follows: d is the distance in meters, g is 9.8, and t
 * is the amount of time, in seconds, that the object has been falling.
 * Write a function named fallingDistance that accepts an objectâ€™s falling time (in
 * seconds) as an argument. The function should return the distance, in meters, that the
 * object has fallen during that time interval. Write a program that demonstrates the
 * function by calling it in a loop that passes the values 1 through 10 as arguments and
 * displays the return value.
