 * Purpose: 17. Personal Best
 * Write a program that asks for the name of a pole vaulter and the dates and vault
 * heights (in meters) of the athleteâ€™s three best vaults. It should then report, in order of
 * height (best first), the date on which each vault was made and its height.
 * Input Validation: Only accept values between 2.0 and 5.0 for the heights.
